Project 😀
Project made easy

About 😁
In this project, we were given two files, a CSV file containing data about music track title, composer, label, and many other features including track genre. The JSON file consists of technical details about a soundtrack including valence and danceability.

We were given the task to build a classifier for this dataset which was highly unbalanced and then deploying that model to any of the cloud services.
